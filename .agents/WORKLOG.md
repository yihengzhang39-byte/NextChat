### Completed

- Migrated the cloned NextChat project to
  `https://github.com/ronvis7/iflytek_chat.git`.
- Renamed the original remote from `origin` to `upstream`.
- Added the new repository as `origin`.
- Pushed local `main` to `origin/main`.
- Added initial development governance documents under `.agents/`.
- Added `docker-compose.override.yml` so Docker builds the local source code as
  `iflytek-chat:local`.
- Built and started the local Docker container.
- Verified `http://localhost:3000` returns HTTP 200.
- Started implementation of the Web Chat secondary development plan:
  PostgreSQL/Prisma schema, SMS login APIs, feedback APIs, product login page,
  feedback pages, Iflytek default model settings, and deployment notes.

### Decisions

- **Product positioning**: This fork is dedicated to 讯飞星火. The long-term
  plan is to simplify the UI to a single-model interface (like DeepSeek web
  client) — no model/provider switching.
- **Temporary model for testing**: Since Iflytek's latest API key is not yet
  available, we will use Baidu ERNIE 5.0 (`ernie5.0`) as a temporary model to
  verify the chat interface. Baidu API Key obtained; Secret Key pending
  (expected 2026-06-26).
- **Server-side config approach**: Model credentials will be configured via
  `.env` so the frontend chat works immediately with zero manual setup.

### Reason

- Prepare the project for secondary development in the owner's repository.
- Make future handoff, review, and progress tracking easier.

### Next

- Get Baidu Secret Key → implement ernie5.0 support → verify chat.
- Get Iflytek API key → switch back to Iflytek → simplify UI.
