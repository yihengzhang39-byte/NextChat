### Completed

- Migrated the cloned NextChat project to
  `https://github.com/ronvis7/iflytek_chat.git`.
- Renamed the original remote from `origin` to `upstream`.
- Added the new repository as `origin`.
- Pushed local `main` to `origin/main`.
- Added initial development governance documents under `.agents/`.
- Added `docker-compose.override.yml` so Docker builds the local source code as
  `iflytek-chat:local`.
- Built and started the local Docker container.
- Verified `http://localhost:3000` returns HTTP 200.
- Started implementation of the Web Chat secondary development plan:
  PostgreSQL/Prisma schema, SMS login APIs, feedback APIs, product login page,
  feedback pages, Iflytek default model settings, and deployment notes.

### Reason

- Prepare the project for secondary development in the owner's repository.
- Make future handoff, review, and progress tracking easier.

### Next

- Verify build, Prisma generation, local PostgreSQL migrations, login flow, and
  feedback flow.
